    <img src="AVID_pic2.JPG">
    I went to California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA) right after high school and received my Bachelor's in Mathematics. 
    In that time, I was a recruiter for Cal State LA at Downtown Business Magnet and Belmont High School. I also went to California State University, Bakersfield 
    for my teaching credential and then National University for my Masters in teaching.
